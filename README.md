# Dear hiring manager,

I'm not entirely sure why this was important to you, but I have now created a GitHub account. Take it as a testament of my interest in the job opening for which I applied. 

I attached my resume and LinkedIn URL to this repository.

Look forward to hearing from you. 

Best regards,

Gustaf Tenf√§lt
